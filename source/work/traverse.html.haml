        %h5 Indoor Rock Climbing Magazine (Student Project)
        %p Traverse is a digital magazine best viewed on a tablet. This indoor-rock climbing magazine aims to replicate the high-quality of an outdoor climbing magazine, however geared towards indoor climbing. Topics relate to gym competitions, training guides, or gear reviews.

        %h3 Cover
        %p For the cover, I choose to steer away from the normal format of a magazine, which includes callouts to feature stories. Instead I choose to only include the logo in the middle of the page, keeping the layout simple and aesthetically pleasing. However, it was important to still keep the issue number visible.

        %h3 Table of Contents
        %p The layout for the table of contents is determined by the image, blending the background into the image.

      .item-text
        %h3 Department
        %p This is an example of one of the department pages. Since this magazine is in a digital format, it allowed me to include interactive pages. Here, the user is able to swipe across the bottom of the screen where the displayed shoe will change.

        %h3 Feature Well
        %p This opener to a feature story uses large type over an interesting action photo.

        %h3 Feature Interior
        %p The top of this page includes an image to keep the users attention, while guiding the user to the beginning of the story.

      .item-text
        %h3 Next Month's Cover
        %p Another example of a cover. It is important that the focus of the photos isn't in the center of the page since that is where the logo will always rest. It also helps if the image can guide the users eye to the center.
