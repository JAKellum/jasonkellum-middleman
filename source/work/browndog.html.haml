        %h3 Vision is Priceless
        %p For Vision is Priceless, we were tasked with updating the identity of the brand, as well as creating the new website. Some goals for the project were removing the “eyeball” from the logo, reduce the amount of copy, and incorporate brighter colors which attract audiences of all ages and ethnicity.

        %p Medcom had similar website problems, where they wanted to move way from their current site which was heavy in text and running flash. The goals for this project were to better incorporate the business’s colors, reorganize the content and structure of the website, and increase the overall attractability of the website.
